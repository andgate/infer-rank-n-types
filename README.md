infer-rank-n-types
==================

A modified version of the code from the paper [Practical type inference for arbitrary-rank types](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/higher-rank/), experimenting with the algorithm to make it usable in my language Tap.

I'm not sure what the license this code would fall under...
